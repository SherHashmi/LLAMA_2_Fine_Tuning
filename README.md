# LLAMA 2 Fine-Tuning Project

## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive guide for fine-tuning the LLAMA 2 language model on a custom dataset. The LLAMA 2 model, developed by Meta AI, is a state-of-the-art large language model that can be adapted for a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks through fine-tuning. The project leverages transfer learning to enhance model performance on specific tasks such as text classification, summarization, and question answering.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate how to fine-tune LLAMA 2 for a specific NLP task. This process includes data preprocessing, setting up the training pipeline, and evaluating model performance. Fine-tuning a pre-trained model like LLAMA 2 allows for better accuracy and adaptability for domain-specific applications, reducing the need for training a model from scratch.

## Project Structure
LLAMA_2_Fine_Tuning.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing code for the entire fine-tuning workflow, including:
Loading and preprocessing the dataset.
Configuring and initializing the LLAMA 2 model.
Training the model on a specific task.
Evaluating model performance and fine-tuning for further improvements.

## Prerequisites 
Ensure that you have the following installed on your system:
Python 3.8 or later
Jupyter Notebook
HuggingFace Transformers library
PyTorch
CUDA (for GPU acceleration, optional but recommended)

## Usage
### Step 1: Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/<repository-name>.git
cd <repository-name>

### Step 2: Open the Notebook
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook LLAMA_2_Fine_Tuning.ipynb

### Step 3: Run the Notebook
Follow the steps in the notebook to:

Load your dataset.
Preprocess the data for training.
Fine-tune the LLAMA 2 model on your dataset.
Evaluate the fine-tuned model's performance.

### Step 4: Model Inference
Once the model is fine-tuned, you can test it on new data using the inference section in the notebook. Adjust hyperparameters or retry fine-tuning based on the performance metrics.

## Example Tasks
This project can be adapted for various NLP tasks, including:

Text Classification: Fine-tune the model to classify texts into predefined categories.
Question Answering: Adapt the model for answering questions based on a given context.
Summarization: Fine-tune LLAMA 2 to generate concise summaries of longer documents.
Language Generation: Use the model to generate text based on prompts.

## Customization
To modify the task for your own dataset:

Replace the dataset loading section in the notebook with your own data.
Adjust the preprocessing steps to fit your datasetâ€™s format.
Update the evaluation metrics based on your task requirements (e.g., accuracy, F1 score).
